Install packages.

on a client:
  lua  (Do this first. *Should* be there already but makes a mess if it's not.)
  luci
  dbus
  avahi-utils
  lua-mosquitto  (if available)
  mosquitto-client (mosquitto-client-nossl if short on space.)

on a server:
  mosquitto

Make sure these are run at reboot:
# /etc/init.d/dbus enable
# /etc/init.d/avahi-daemon enable


Test avahi on OpenWRT with
# avahi-browse -a

Test mosquitto with this on the OpenWRT box
# /usr/bin/mosquitto_sub -v -h $MQTT_SERVER -p 1883 -t homeautomation/lighting/#
and this anywhere:
$ mosquitto_pub -h $MQTT_SERVER -t homeautomation/lighting/kitchen/all -m "#000"



Uploading scripts
$ mkdir -p /usr/share/homeautomation/ && scp fs_root/usr/share/homeautomation/homeautomation*.lua  root@192.168.192.9:/usr/share/homeautomation/ && scp fs_root/bin/pubsub.lua root@192.168.192.9:/bin/

TODO:
  Script a solution to copying up files  in /etc/ without overwriting existing settings.
  Modify /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf to allow websockets on port 18883.

  Document setting up OpenWRT.
  Currently "Barrier Breaker" does not have recent enough mosquitto broker to do websockets.
  "Chaos Calmer - trunk" currently has a broken mosquitto implementation.

  To get it running on my GL.iNet board i have to build an image with the OpenWRT Image Generator.
  http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.generate
  Here's the Image Generator line:
    $ make image PROFILE=GLINET PACKAGES="-ppp -ppp-mod-pppoe dbus avahi-utils lua-mosquitto mosquitto-client mosquitto luci"

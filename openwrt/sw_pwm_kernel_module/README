This module turns a GPIO pin into a PWM pin using software timers.
That means it's inefficient compared to hardware PWM but that may be acceptable if CPU usage is expected to be low on the system.


Building:
Modify the Makefile so the OPENWRT variable points to your openwrt build enviroment and run "make".


Install:
scp the new module to your OpenWRT box:
  $ scp gpio-pwm.ko root@$HOST_IP:/lib/modules/3.18.11/

Test load the module on the OpenWRT machine:
  # insmod gpio-pwm.ko
  # dmesg

Auto load the module at boot time (after everyhting else due to "60" being relatively high number.)
  # echo gpio-pwm > /etc/modules.d/60-gpio-pwm


Usage:
When you load the module the following files are created:
  /sys/class/sw_pwm/register_gpio
and
  /sys/class/sw_pwm/unregister_gpio

To register an IO pin with the module do the following:
  $ echo $GPIO_PIN_NUMBER > /sys/class/sw_pwm/register_gpio
You will now see a new file in /sys/class/sw_pwm/ matching the GPIO pin number.

To set the pin doing PWM stuff:
  $ echo $PWM_VALUE > /sys/class/sw_pwm/pwm_$GPIO_PIN_NUMBER
$PWM_VALUE should be between 0 and 255.
0 = 0% duty cycle (off).
255 = 100% duty cycle.

You can see what pins are registered and their PWM values by reading /sys/class/sw_pwm/register_gpio:
  $ cat /sys/class/sw_pwm/register_gpio

You can register a maximum number of GPIO pins defined by MAX_SW_PWMS.
